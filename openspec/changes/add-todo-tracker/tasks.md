## Implementation
- [x] Create database structures for tasks and recurring schedules (base task definition plus per-day occurrence/completion tracking).
- [x] Wire up Todo routes, controller, and view with date selector, summary widget row, and global listing component integration.
- [x] Build create/edit flows with form request validation for title, priority options, due date, and recurrence settings.
- [x] Implement completion toggle, delete handling, and occurrence regeneration so recurring tasks surface on the correct days.
- [x] Populate Blade templates with Tailwind styling and Alpine interactions for inline editing and summary widget updates.
- [x] Manually verify CRUD flows, recurrence behaviours, and summary counts for a variety of dates; capture any seed data adjustments needed for QA.
- [x] Validate each scenario in `openspec/changes/add-todo-tracker/specs/todo-planner/spec.md` through manual walkthroughs and note any discrepancies for follow-up fixes.
- [x] Document the date and outcome of the manual walkthroughs so future work can reference which scenarios were exercised and any gaps observed. _(2025-10-30: Verified create/edit/delete, daily and selected-day recurrence, completion toggles, summary widgets, and listing inline actions across multiple dates; no gaps observed.)_
- [x] Run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` on touched PHP files before finishing.
