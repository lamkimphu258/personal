## Implementation
- [ ] Define Blade/Alpine chart layout component with filter controls (week/month/year/custom) and slot for datasets.
- [ ] Create dedicated bar chart component for categorical datasets such as Top Foods.
- [ ] Extend dashboard controller/view to source current/target weight widgets and arrow status.
- [ ] Implement weight trend, calorie-goal adherence, and top-food charts using the shared component.
- [ ] Add backend aggregation queries for calorie-goal counts and top 10 foods within selected ranges.
- [ ] Seed representative dashboard data (weights, nutrition profile, varied food entries) so each chart renders during manual QA.
- [ ] Ensure Tailwind/Vite assets updated and run `npm run build` if needed for manual verification.
- [ ] Format touched PHP files with `vendor/bin/pint --dirty`.
