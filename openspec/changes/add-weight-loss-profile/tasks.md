## 1. Schema & Model
- [ ] Create a migration and model to persist a single nutrition profile with the required inputs and derived targets.

## 2. Nutrition Calculations
- [ ] Implement a dedicated service/Action that computes BMR, activity-adjusted maintenance calories, safe deficit, and macro targets (protein, fat, carbs, fibre) from the stored inputs.

## 3. HTTP Layer
- [ ] Build a controller, form request, route, and Blade view for the profile page so I can review and update my details and see the latest targets.

## 4. Manual Verification
- [ ] Load the profile page, update fields across the safe ranges (including extremes), and confirm calories/macros look reasonable before sharing the change for review.
