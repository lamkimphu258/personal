# Task Completion Checklist
1. Update or add relevant specs under `openspec/` before implementation when scope changes.
2. Implement code changes following Laravel conventions and keep controllers/services thin.
3. Run targeted tests with `php artisan test` (filter as needed) and execute `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` for formatting.
4. Summarize the work, list follow-up steps (migrations, builds), and request full test run if only partial tests executed.
